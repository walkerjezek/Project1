# Project1- My MDb :movie_camera:	

## Description 
For this group project we decided to create a movie database access page. This application allows the user the input a movie title into the search form to get random trivia of the movie and its ratings. This helps the user decide if this is a movie they would want to watch based on the output. 

While working on this project we learned how to collaborate and solve issues and resolve any obstacles that came up. 

## Features :clapper:
To assist the user, the ratings number changes color based on the ratings.

- Higher rated films are green
- Middle rated films are orange
- Low rated films are red
